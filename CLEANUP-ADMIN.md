# 🧹 CLEANUP: Remove Admin from Main Bhisey Project

## 📋 Overview

The main Bhisey project currently has admin pages that should be removed since you now have a **separate admin portal**. The public website should only show public-facing pages.

---

## ✅ What's Already Correct

Your public website (`/resources/blog` and `/resources/case-studies`) is **already properly configured** to fetch data from the backend:

1. ✅ Uses Redux to fetch blogs from backend
2. ✅ Uses Redux to fetch case studies from backend
3. ✅ Displays data dynamically
4. ✅ No hardcoded data

**No changes needed for resources pages!**

---

## 🗑️ What Needs to be Removed

### Admin Pages to Delete

```bash
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey

# Delete entire admin folder
rm -rf src/app/admin/
```

This will remove:
- `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- `src/app/admin/login/`
- `src/app/admin/blogs/`
- `src/app/admin/case-studies/`
- `src/app/admin/admin-components.css`

---

## 🔍 Verify What Will Remain

After cleanup, your main Bhisey project structure will be:

```
bhisey/
├── backend/                    # Backend API (deployed to Render)
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── page.js            # Home page
│   │   ├── company/           # Company pages
│   │   ├── contact-us/        # Contact page
│   │   ├── partners/          # Partners page
│   │   ├── resources/         # ✅ PUBLIC: Blog & Case Studies
│   │   │   ├── blog/          # ✅ Fetches from backend
│   │   │   ├── case-studies/  # ✅ Fetches from backend
│   │   │   └── news/
│   │   ├── services/          # Services pages
│   │   ├── verticals/         # Verticals pages
│   │   └── why-Bhisey/        # Why Bhisey pages
│   ├── components/            # React components
│   ├── store/                 # Redux (for fetching data)
│   └── lib/                   # Utilities

## 📝 Step-by-Step Cleanup

### Step 1: Backup (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey

# Create a backup of admin folder just in case
mkdir -p ../backups
cp -r src/app/admin ../backups/admin-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### Step 2: Delete Admin Folder

```bash
# Delete the admin section
rm -rf src/app/admin/
```

### Step 3: Verify Deletion

```bash
# List app directory - should not see 'admin/'
ls -la src/app/

# Expected output (without admin/):
# company/
# contact-us/
# globals.css
# layout.js
# page.js
# partners/
# resources/
# services/
# verticals/
# why-Bhisey/
```

### Step 4: Check for Admin References

```bash
# Search for any remaining admin references
grep -r "admin" src/app/ --exclude-dir=node_modules

# If you find any admin imports or references, remove them
```

### Step 5: Test the Public Website

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
# Test these pages:
# - / (Home)
# - /resources/blog (Should show blogs from backend)
# - /resources/case-studies (Should show case studies from backend)
# - All other public pages should work
```

---

## ✅ What the Public Website Should Do

### For Blog Page (`/resources/blog`)

1. ✅ Fetch blogs from: `https://bhisey-backend-api.onrender.com/api/blogs`
2. ✅ Display blog list with filtering
3. ✅ Show blog categories and tags
4. ✅ Link to individual blog posts
5. ❌ NO admin controls (Create, Edit, Delete)

### For Case Studies Page (`/resources/case-studies`)

1. ✅ Fetch case studies from: `https://bhisey-backend-api.onrender.com/api/case-studies`
2. ✅ Display case study list with filtering
3. ✅ Show testimonials section
4. ✅ Link to individual case studies
5. ❌ NO admin controls (Create, Edit, Delete)

---

## 🔧 Verify Backend Connection

The public website should use the same backend URL:

**Check `.env.example` or `.env.local` in main Bhisey project:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://bhisey-backend-api.onrender.com
```

If not set, add it:

```bash
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey

# Create or update .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://bhisey-backend-api.onrender.com" >> .env.local
```

---

## 🎯 Final Project Separation

After cleanup, you'll have:

### 1. **Main Bhisey Website** (Public)
- **Location**: `/Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey/`
- **Purpose**: Public-facing website
- **Port**: 3000
- **Access**: Anyone can visit
- **Pages**: 
  - Home, Company, Services, Verticals, etc.
  - Resources (Blog & Case Studies) - Read-only
- **Data**: Fetches from backend API

### 2. **Admin Portal** (Private)
- **Location**: `/Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey-admin-portal/`
- **Purpose**: Content management
- **Port**: 3001
- **Access**: Admin login required
- **Pages**:
  - Login
  - Dashboard
  - Blogs Management (Create, Edit, Delete)
  - Case Studies Management (Create, Edit, Delete)
- **Data**: Manages backend API data

### 3. **Backend API** (Deployed)
- **Location**: Render (https://bhisey-backend-api.onrender.com)
- **Purpose**: Data storage and API
- **Accessed by**:
  - Main website (Read blogs & case studies)
  - Admin portal (Full CRUD operations)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After cleanup, test these:

### Public Website (port 3000)
- [ ] Home page loads
- [ ] Blog page shows blogs from backend
- [ ] Case studies page shows case studies from backend
- [ ] No admin links or pages visible
- [ ] All navigation works
- [ ] Can't access `/admin` (should 404)

### Admin Portal (port 3001)
- [ ] Login page works
- [ ] Can login with admin credentials
- [ ] Dashboard shows statistics
- [ ] Can navigate to Blogs and Case Studies pages
- [ ] Completely separate from main website

---

## 📜 Quick Commands

```bash
# === CLEANUP ===
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey
rm -rf src/app/admin/

# === TEST PUBLIC WEBSITE ===
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey
npm run dev
# Open: http://localhost:3000

# === TEST ADMIN PORTAL ===
cd /Users/amitkumar/Documents/glidex/bhisey-admin-portal
npm run dev
# Open: http://localhost:3001
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Don't delete `backend/` folder** - That's your API server
2. **Don't delete `src/store/`** - Public website needs it to fetch data
3. **Don't delete `src/lib/api/`** - Public website needs it for API calls
4. **Only delete `src/app/admin/`** - This is the admin UI

---

## 🎉 Result

After cleanup:

```
✅ Main Bhisey (public) → Clean, no admin pages
✅ Admin Portal (private) → Separate, secure admin interface
✅ Backend API → Shared by both, deployed on Render
✅ Complete separation of concerns
```

---
